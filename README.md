# Gritcoin

A simple self-improvement positive reinforcement system that is intentionally easy at first, but gradually gets MUCH harder over time, eventually requiring you to go outside your comfort zone more and more until you finally get some GRIT.

## Dependencies

Python 3.x

## Usage

This program takes zero arguments. Once ran, you are dropped into a basic command-line shell. Pressing the letter shown above the prompt, followed by enter, will earn you 1 gritcoin. At first, it is the easiest way to earn gritcoins. Typing "store" will show you all of the purchases you can make and the various levels of accomplishment that you can trade for extra gritcoins. Typing "accomplishments" will list all of the things that you have accomplished since using the program. Typing the exact name of any list element from the store will either purchase something or exchange an accomplishment for gritcoins.

## Store

The things that you can purchase are either basic elements of typical recreational activity, or basic necessities of life. It is intentionally next to impossible to go a single day without having to spend at least 1 gritcoin on something. Additionally, whenever you do purchase an item, that item increases in price by 1 gritcoin, forcing the user to eventually resort to small accomplishments. Later on, small accomplishments won't be enough either (as accomplishments do not increase in reward as you exchange them for gritcoins), forcing the user to resort to medium accomplishments, and then large accomplishments, and then extreme accomplishments. Once you are no longer able to provide enough gritcoins to pay for basic necessities, it is obviously okay to stop using the program.
